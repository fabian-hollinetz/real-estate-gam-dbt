## Overview

This report presents a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) for real estate
price prediction. The model is built on a clean, reproducible pipeline
combining dbt-based feature engineering and a Python GAM implementation.

---

## Experiment Configuration

This report corresponds to the baseline experiment:

- Experiment: `baseline_gam.yaml`
- Model: LinearGAM
- Target: Price per m²

---

## Data Loading

```{python}
from pathlib import Path
from real_estate_gam.run_gam import main

PROJECT_ROOT = Path().resolve().parent
results = main(experiment_path=PROJECT_ROOT / "experiments/baseline_gam.yaml",
               return_results=True)

# Model Performance metrics
gam = results["gam"]
X = results["X"]
y = results["y"]
feature_names = results["feature_names"]
metrics = results["metrics"]

# Partial Dependence Plots

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

for i, name in enumerate(feature_names):
  XX = gam.generate_X_grid(term=i)
  plt.figure()
  plt.plot(XX[:, i], gam.partial_dependence(term=i, X=XX))
  plt.title(f"Effect of {name}")
  plt.xlabel(name)
  plt.ylabel("Price effect")
  plt.tight_layout()
  plt.show()
```

## Key Takeaways

- The GAM captures strong non-linear effects.
- Categorical variables show clear price differentials.
- The model achieves solid explanatory power while remaining interpretable.

## Reproducibility
This report was generated from a fully reproducible pipeline.
To reproduce:
python3 -m src.run_gam
quarto render reports/gam_report.qmd

Source code and configuration are available in the public repository.
